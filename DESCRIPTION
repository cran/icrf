Description: Implements interval censored recursive forests (ICRF) based on Cho, Jewell, and Kosorok (2021+). 
            ICRF is a variant of random forests where the outcome variable is interval censored survival data.
            It can be used for usual right censored data and current status data as well.
            A recursion technique is used to improve accuracy and smoothed survival curves are provided.
