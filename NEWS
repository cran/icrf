icrf v2.0.0 (Release date: 2021-05-10)
==============

Changes:

* Changes to icrf.default.R to modify the default bandwidth values
  (1. Changed from n to nodesize. 2. When IQR is more than tau/2, use tau/2 instead of IQR).
* Changes to icrf.default.R to add the aliases of the split.rule arguments.
* Changes to icrf.default.R to remove the virtually tied timepoints.
* Changes to survrf.c to fix error in updating the individual conditional probability at the inifinity time point.
* Changes to icrf.formula.R to remove time and status from the design matrix for a full model (~ .).
* Changes to survplot.R to fix the error in the smooth argument.
* Changes to ksmooth.c and icrf.default.R to handle numerical differentiation/integration error (Often pdf does not integrate to 1).
* Changes to npmle.c and NPMLE_new.R to handle errors caused by interval bounds that coincide with tau.
* Changes to npmle.c and NPMLE_new.R to overcome the incorrect allocation of probability to a finite interval instead of the final infinite interval in EMICM.
* Addition of Icens.R to internalize the Icens package since it is not available on CRAN any more.
* Changes to survrf.c to handle error in mirror kernel (instantaneous hazard was previously not incorporated).
